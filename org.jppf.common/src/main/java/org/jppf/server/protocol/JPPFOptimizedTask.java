/**
 * This class optimizes the serialization behavior of JPPFTask, by only handling
 * the <code>getResult()</code> and <code>getException()</code> fields of the task once it has been executed.
 * This reduces the serialization and network transport overhead, especially for tasks that use large amounts of input data,
 * or generate large amount of instance data during their execution.
 * <p>This class should be used as in the following example:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyTask extends JPPFOptimizedTask {
 * 
 *   private MyClass myField = ...;
 * 
 *   public void run() {
 *       // ...
 *   }
 * 
 *   private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream out) throws IOException {
 *     serialize(out);
 *   }
 * 
 *   private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
 *     deserialize(in);
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
